                                <strong>How you can describe yourself?</strong>
                                <p>Quick to absorb and analyse information, imaginative, enthusiastic, energetic and
                                    outgoing, approachable, diplomatic and flexible, a clear communicator, in person and
                                    writing, interested in people and what motivates their choices.</p>

                                <strong>How would you outline your professional profile?</strong>
                                <p>Basically, my role is to be the client representative within the advertising/web
                                    agency, and the agency representative to the client. I meet with clients and talk
                                    through what they want from their campaign (on line, above the line or below: any
                                    kind of communication/advertising project it’s in their minds), who they want to
                                    target, how much they have available to invest, and their objectives, such as
                                    raising brand awareness or increasing sales. I then do any necessary background
                                    research and produce a brief to present to the creative and technical teams. Then,
                                    with the creative department, develop and implement the campaign.</p>

                                <p>Good communication skills are essential as taking in and passing on information is a
                                    key function of my job. Because it’s such a fast-paced environment, it’s also
                                    important I’m able to manage your time effectively and prioritise tasks. There is an
                                    element of creativity in the role; certainly being able to recognise good creative
                                    work is important, and it also helps to really enjoy the work and be able to have
                                    fun with it.</p>

                                <strong>Do you use any special tools or equipment?</strong>
                                <p>My computer and my mobile phone are my main tools. I use my computer to prepare
                                    presentations and produce spreadsheets and other documents. It also has a finance
                                    system, as one of my responsibilities as account handler is to set and organise the
                                    budgets, raising purchase orders and invoicing the client. Also I’m always available
                                    to speak with my clients by phone and to check my e-mail account (almost 7/24).</p>

                                    deal with. For me every new project is a new challange and the key of access to a

This experience was about an international event and had importance at European level, the event (4 days of workshops, conferences and meetings) was based into the Vatican University and had a great echo in that specialistic sector. 

It was a very important opportunity to improve my skills about:

TOSM aims to promote and improve the matching among ICT entrepreneurs and enterprises that search in ICT concrete answers for competitiveness.
<br/>
During this event I had the pleasure to ideate an ambush marketing event insert into the main event (Tosm 2009). 
<br/>
The event consisted in the design of a mini-event within the main event: to promote the national work contract employee in the computer industry, five ballet dancers posed in the stands of some exhibitors intent in reading the book-contact immobiles as if they were Greek statues and regular time intervals they met with each other at certain points of the exhibition space and staging a classical dance choreography. The mantle of this costume, in full view, was exposed the national logo of the Italian Contract of employment of employees in the computer industry and the book was the subject of the contract at the center of each dance. This mini event has gained much interest and media coverage as it had covered a topic concerning the event but spoke a language totally alien to technology and ICT. As often happens, the effect of alienation had a very strong impact.
<br/>
Main activities: 
1 ambush marketing event concept,
2 define event targets and communication goals,
3 economy management, 
4 coordination,
5 briefing, 
6 media planning,
7 below and above the line advertising,
8 on line awareness, 
9 web sites and banner,
10 leaflets, and so on.
 <br/>
Statistics on the past edition:
1 More than 3300 business visitors;
2 150 exhibitors;
3 12 operators from Europe and Middle East;
4 More than 130 b2b meeting;
5 More than 60 company workshops." rel="prettyPhoto[mixed]">

Bacardi Martini has always maintained a special relationship with Barmaids and Bartenders. The success of its products is a result of the confidence that these professionals have always bestowed upon them.

Hence, for the past 43 years they have organised the Bacardi Martini Grand Prix, with an aim to identify and showcase emerging Bartenders and Barmaids at both national and international levels. 

During 2009 Edition I had the pleasure to coollaborate with the organization of this international event while I was working at Orange021 advertising agency of Turin, Italy.
